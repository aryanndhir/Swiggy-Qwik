# [Swiggy Qwik - Your One-stop Shopping Application](https://github.com/swiggy-2022-bootcamp/cdp-team1/)

We've learned to seek engaging in-hand comfy experiences from every service provider as smartphones transform mundane chores like food ordering, taxi and more. And the e-commerce industry is no exception. Consumers are transforming into a lifestyle where they who do not want to waste time commuting to different places to shop different goods. They want to discover things quickly at the comfort of their homes, order products, get them delivered in a day or two. In a country with growing internet adaptation, this demand is going to surge more in the coming years. That alone appears to be sufficient reason to persuade an e-commerce application that is scalable, distributed and loosely coupled - providing more agility, flexibility and resilience. Here's exactly where Swiggy Qwik comes into picture ! Come on, let's dive more.
